# chat.18f.gov

This site allows the general public to request access to 18F's public chat rooms by submitting a Google Form. This used to use [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin), but was converted to this simpler format for security reasons (doesn't require any permissions). 18F staff can edit the form [here](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1vcsvQ64qt5mYNyVajcwtYDRMqEOyPzsXZBGM5c4_BD8/edit?usp=sharing).
