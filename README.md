# chat.18f.gov

This site allows the general public to request access to 18F's public chat rooms by submitting a Google Form. This used to use [slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin), but was converted to this simpler format for security reasons (doesn't require any permissions). It is hosted on Federalist.

## Adding new public channels

_18F staff only._

1. Reach out to [#admins-slack](https://18f.slack.com/messages/admins-slack/), saying:
    * The reasoning for creating the channel
    * Who will be the moderators
1. [Create the channel in Slack](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201402297-Creating-a-channel). The channel name should end in `-public`, so that it's explicit that non-staff are present.
1. Add a new multiple-choice option to [the form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/1vcsvQ64qt5mYNyVajcwtYDRMqEOyPzsXZBGM5c4_BD8/edit?usp=sharing).
